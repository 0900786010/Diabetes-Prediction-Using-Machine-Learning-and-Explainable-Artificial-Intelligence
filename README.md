Machine Learning Project â€“ Diabetes Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting diabetes using the BRFSS 2015 dataset. It includes data preprocessing (SMOTE, scaling), ensemble modeling (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM), performance evaluation (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score), and model explainability with SHAP.
